The measure package contains play implementations for a measurement facility.

It is a number of play implementations.

The measure.orig package contains the original attempt.

The measure.sandbox shows some sketchy ideas (independent time separated play).

In the sandbox the last thing was Test2 which was a quick hack incorporating
some of the ideas of the other sketchy ideas. It is messy and needs refinement.
